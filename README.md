# Car-Automation---Object-Tracking-
In this project, I implemented the MobileNet-SSD model, an efficient object detection network optimized for mobile and embedded devices. I configured the network architecture, including convolution and detection output layers, enabling real-time detection and classification of multiple objects in images, balancing speed and accuracy.
